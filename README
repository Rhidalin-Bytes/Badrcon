Badrcon.py
# Description
    Badrcon reads the console.log of q3 engines and looks for
    bad rcon packets and attempts to block the offending ip
    at the Operating system level, written for winnt and 
    linux, command lines are flexible but IMPORTANT, I've
    included two example files which will work with WinServer2003
    and Ubuntu Linux, DO NOT change these unless you know 
    EXACTLY what you are doing,
